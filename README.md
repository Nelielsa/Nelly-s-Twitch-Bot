**FAQ:**

> **Why doesn't some hotkeys work in the game i'm playing?**
> *Some games have a different method of "keypress" which means the bot will not fully work with them, this is being worked on as time goes but please report this in the bug/report section on discord so we know what games and what keys aren't working.*

> **Why doesn't it work when i redeem channel points or use bits, but the test button works?**
> This is most likely due to the Access Token not having the needed credentials for your channel, re-watch the tutorial video or go through the README file provided with the download, if this issue still occurs then please post the issue in the bug/report section on discord for further assistance.

> **My points/bits will not trigger the actions i have put in**
> Make sure you always save/quicksave your settings before testing as any changes done is not automatically changed.
