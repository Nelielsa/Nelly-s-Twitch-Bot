**FAQ:**

> **I have issues and i need help**
> Join my discord and post your issues in the Issues section, i'll help ASAP. https://discord.gg/8MQqy2nvs5

> **Why doesn't some hotkeys work in the game i'm playing?**
> *Some games have a different method of "keypress" which means the bot will not fully work with them, this is being worked on as time goes but please report this in the bug/report section on discord so we know what games and what keys aren't working.*

> **Why doesn't it work when i redeem channel points or use bits, but the test button works?**
> This is most likely due to the Access Token or Client ID not having the needed credentials for your channel, go through the README here, if this issue still occurs then please post the issue in the bug/report section on discord for further assistance.

> **My points/bits will not trigger the actions i have put in**
> Make sure you always save/quicksave your settings before testing as any changes done is not automatically changed.

> **The Bot tells me i'm missing credentials**
> If it does that then click "Continue" and see if it works with channel points, if it does then it's just a false error due to Twitch API.

**NOTE: The bot might disconnect after 4 hours of usage, just restart the bot and it works fine again, this is an issue i'm working hard on to fix.**
