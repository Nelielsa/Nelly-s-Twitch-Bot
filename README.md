# FAQ
I have issues and i need help
> Join my discord and post your issues in the Issues section, i'll help ASAP. https://discord.gg/8MQqy2nvs5

Why doesn't some hotkeys work in the game i'm playing?
> Some games have a different method of "keypress" which means the bot will not fully work with them, this is being worked on as time goes but please report this in the bug/report section on discord so we know what games and what keys aren't working.

Why doesn't it work when i redeem channel points or use bits, but the test button works?
> This is most likely due to the Access Token or Client ID not having the needed credentials for your channel, go through the README here, if this issue still occurs then please post the issue in the bug/report section on discord for further assistance.

I'm not an affiliate on twitch, can i use it?
> Both yes and no, the bot is meant for affiliates and partners, however you can use the features that does not require channel points, subs or bits, but i can not guarantee it will be stable for you.

My points/bits will not trigger the actions i have put in
> Make sure you always save/quicksave your settings before testing as any changes done is not automatically changed.

The Bot tells me i'm missing credentials
> If it does that then click "Continue" and see if it works with channel points, if it does then it's just a false error due to Twitch API.

I want some more features on this bot!
> Message me on Discord or Twitter, i'll be happy to listen to the ideas!

Can i be your sponsor or partnership with you for free?
> Yes anyone can for any of my bots, Message me on Discord or Twitter and we can discuss it. (no payments)

I want to support you but i don't have anything to spare, can i support you somehow?
> By following me you support me, if you want to support me more then watching my streams, joining my community and/or having the Sponsor Logo on your Twitch page will help greatly as well as helping advertising the bots i have.

Something like this already exists, why make it?
> There will always be something similar, but anything can be improved and made different, this program is *local* on your computer and can be edited to your liking.

**NOTE: The bot might disconnect after 6 hours of usage, just restart the bot and it works fine again, this is an issue i'm working hard on to fix.**
